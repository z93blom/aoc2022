My C# solutions to the advent of code problems.
Check out http://adventofcode.com.

## Dependencies

- `Newtonsoft.Json` for JSON parsing
- `HtmlAgilityPack` is used for problem download.

## Setting the session variable
The application depends on an environment variable. To get your identifier, you need to
look at the request headers for your daily data, and take the session identifier from
the cookie in the Request Headers (for example https://adventofcode.com/2018/day/1/input)

Then you can set it:

```
Powershell: $Env:AOC-SESSION = "..."

Command Prompt: set AOC-SESSION = ...
```

## Running

To run the project:

1. Install .NET (7.0 or greater)
2. Clone the repo
3. Get help with `dotnet run`
```

Usage: dotnet run [arguments]
Supported arguments:

 [year]/[day|last|all] Solve the specified problems

 last                  Solve the last problem
 all                   Solve everything

To start working on new problems:
               
 update [year]/[day]   Prepares a folder for the given day, updates the input, 
                       the readme and creates a solution template.
